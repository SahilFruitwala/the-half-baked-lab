After years of experimenting with different tools and workflows, we've settled on a core set of applications and services that power our creative process. Here's our current toolkit and why we love each piece.

## Development Environment

### Code Editors
- **VS Code** - Our primary editor with a carefully curated set of extensions
- **PyCharm** - Better than VS Code but not for everytone, mainly used for Python

### Terminal & Shell
- **Ghostty** with **Oh My Zsh** - Beautiful, customizable, powerful and fast

## Design & Creativity

### Visual Design
- **Excalidraw** - Perfect for quick sketches and system diagrams

## Development Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js** - Our framework of choice for React applications
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling that speeds up development
- **Framer Motion** - When we need smooth animations and interactions
- **v0.dev** - AI coding tool to fast prototyping/MVP and beautiful designs

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** - Postgres database with real-time features and auth
- **Turso** - Sqlite database lightweight and fast operation
- **FastAPI** - FastAPI is modern and comes with better tooling
- **ORM** - We use `SQLAlchemy` mainly but when Sahil gets frustrated with it's annoyance he switches to `Djnago ORM`

### APIs & Services

## Computers & Accessories | Sahil

- **MacBook M2 Air** - Primary development machine

- **MX Master 3S** - Better for yoru hands and argonomics, mainly he likes it.
- **HP Display** - You can't work on 13" laptop

## Computers & Accessories | Purva

- **Logitech K585 Slim Combo** - It comes in pink
- **Asus Display** - Better for Sahil's code review.
- **Standing desk** - She just sits though.


## Conclusion

The best tools are the ones you don't have to think about. They fade into the background and let you focus on creating. While it's tempting to constantly chase the newest, shiniest tools, we've found that mastering a smaller set of reliable options is more valuable than being a jack-of-all-trades with dozens of half-learned applications.

That said, we're always open to trying new things. If you have a tool that's transformed your workflow, we'd love to hear about it!
